# Siddhuceros-Method
An optimized algorithm (Siddhuceros Method) to compute and store squares using only additions instead of multiplications.
# How I Created this
once upon a time when i was memorising the squares of **1 to 20**, i noticed the pattern and saw that we can calculate squares without multiplying the numbers.
In one sentence **"Addition over Multiplication"**.
